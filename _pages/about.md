I'm a current master's student in mathematics at University of Wisconsin - Madison, and I expected to gain my master's degree in May 2023. I've earned my bachelor's degree in information and computing science from Zhejiang University in 2021. My research interests focus on applied mathematics related to scientific computing, numerical algorithms and analysis, machine learning, data science, etc.
